### **Key Modifications in This Fork**

1. **Change .Net version to 8.0**: .NET 8 brings long‚Äëterm support, performance improvements, modern C# features, single‚Äëfile publishing, trimming, and Native AOT options. Even though the Steamworks interaction keeps the application Windows‚Äëonly, these runtime enhancements can still reduce startup time and memory usage and provide a more maintainable foundation.
2. **Switch to x64 architecture**: Now it's a Windows 64-bit program.
3. **Search Function Improvement**: Allows users to search for achievements or descriptions, enhancing convenience and accuracy.  
4. **Multi-language Support**: SAM.Game will initially fetch achievements in the default language. Users can then select a preferred language and press "Refresh" to display achievements in the chosen language.  
5. **Countdown to Commit Achievements**: Users can set a countdown timer for committing achievements. Multiple achievements and their respective countdown durations can be configured, and the "Enable Timer" button will execute the countdown.
6. **Some UI tweaks**: Sorting by listview columns by [r33yl](https://github.com/r33yl), prevent Steam client show activicaty as idle (only when SAM.Game in foreground and turned-on).  
7. **Icon cache**: Implemented icon cache for SAM.Picker and SAM.Game. Cache folder is under program folder named "appcache".  
8. **Game list cache**: Implemented game list cache for SAM.Picker. Cache folder is under binaries folder named "appcache".
